We have developed a website entirely using Servlet and JSP. 
This website will simulate the functionalities of an online course management system. The interface is very attractive. We used a component library Bootstrap to beautify the website within your JSP page.
In addition, the website is integrated with a backend database MySQL database. The website fullfills the following requirements:

1: It is able to handle three types of users: a student, a teacher and an admin.
2: Each user needs to be authenticated using username and password. One can directly create user like student or teacher account in this system with their
corresponding user types (e.g. student, teacher ).
3: An admin user is able to add new courses in the system and assign a particular teacher to a corresponding course.
4: A student user can register for a new course and view all his/her registered courses.
5: A teacher user have access to view his/her corresponding registered course(s) and to select a particular course, from these registered courses, to view the list of the registered students for that particular course.
